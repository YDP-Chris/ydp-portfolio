# PulseCheck ⚡
> Your D365 jobs at a glance

## What it does

PulseCheck is a batch job heartbeat monitor for Microsoft Dynamics 365 that transforms you from reactive to proactive. No more discovering failed jobs from angry users – catch issues before they impact your business.

**The Chris Story**: It's Monday morning. Chris opens PulseCheck and immediately sees the customer import job showing 'Time since last success: 14h ago' in bold red. He fixes the issue before a single user notices. For the first time in months, he's ahead of the problems instead of chasing them.
