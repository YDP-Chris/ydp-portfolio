## 🤖 What Makes This Different

This isn't just another developer portfolio. It's a **living demonstration of autonomous development** - where AI agents build new products while I sleep.

**4 Working Products Across Diverse Industries:**
- 🍷 **Valley Somm** - AI-powered wine trip planner with reservations
- ⏱️ **HoursToImpact** - Nonprofit volunteer tracking with ML predictions
- 🗺️ **RouteRef** - Field service territory lookup for logistics teams
- 🎸 **FretUnlock** - Interactive guitar practice tool for intermediate players

**Every product is live with real users** - no mockups, no "coming soon" placeholders.
