**See scales, feel the music**

## What is FretFlow?

FretFlow is a guitar scale visualizer that transforms how you learn and play scales. Instead of memorizing patterns, you see the music come alive on your fretboard.

The screenshot above shows the pentatonic scale highlighted across the neck. As you play, the dots light up in sequence, creating a visual trail that follows your melody in real-time.

## How it works

1. **Choose your scale** - Select from popular scales like pentatonic, major, minor, and more
2. **See the pattern** - Scale notes light up across the entire fretboard
3. **Start playing** - Tap the highlighted dots or play your real guitar
4. **Watch the magic** - FretFlow detects your melody and creates a visual trail as you play

That's it. No complex theory, no boring exercises. Just play and watch your music come to life.

## The moment it clicks

You'll know FretFlow is working when you play a sequence of scale notes and suddenly hear something that actually sounds musical. The visual feedback helps you understand not just *where* to play, but *how* scales connect to create melodies.
